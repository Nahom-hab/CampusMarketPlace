# CampusMarketplace

## About the Project

**CampusMarketplace** is a mobile-first marketplace app built specifically for university students to buy, sell, and trade products within their campus community. The app aims to create a secure, convenient, and engaging environment where students can easily connect, communicate, and conduct transactions related to campus essentials â€” such as textbooks, electronics, furniture, clothing, and more.

Our platform addresses common challenges faced by students trying to buy and sell goods locally by offering:

- **User authentication** for secure and personalized access  
- **Intuitive product listing** with images, descriptions, and pricing  
- **Advanced search and filtering** by category, price, and keywords  
- **Real-time chat system** for direct communication between buyers and sellers  
- **User-friendly profile management** and product editing  
- **Shopping cart** to save items and streamline purchases  
- **Help and support services** for user assistance

The app is designed with modern UI/UX principles to ensure a clean, responsive, and smooth experience tailored to the fast-paced student lifestyle.
